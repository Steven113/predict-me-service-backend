    Added MongoDBManager for opening a connection to a certain database at a certain IP and port, and inserting into a collection. Added a MonoDBDocumentCompatibleObject interface to let objects specify that they can be converted to MongoDBDocuments. The interface was chosen over a factory to give the person writing the class control over what fields can be put in the document. When a user submits a list of shopping items, the list is put in a UserSelectedShoppingItems object and then turned into a Document and put into the given collection. Renamed Main class to App for slightly better clarity.

    Refactored code to divide classes into packages. Moved configuration from Main class into a seperate class instantiated from the Main class. The Routes are now in a seperate class that loads the configuration information from the Main class and exposes the Routes to the Main class.
